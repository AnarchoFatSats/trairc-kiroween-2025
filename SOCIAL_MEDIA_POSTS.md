🎯 **Excited to announce TRAIRC - our submission for the #Kiroween Hackathon!**

Pharmaceutical companies spend $100B+ on AI drug discovery, but most models achieve only 50% accuracy on external validation. That's random chance.

We built TRAIRC to solve this crisis.

**What it does:**
→ Analyzes Type II kinase inhibitors (critical cancer drugs)
→ 87.7% validated accuracy on FDA-approved drugs
→ Real-time molecular analysis in seconds
→ Production-ready web interface

**Built entirely with @Kiro AI:**
• Vibe coding for rapid exploration
• Spec-driven development for structure
• Agent collaboration throughout

This isn't a prototype. It's a live product solving a real $100B problem.

🧬 Just submitted TRAIRC to #Kiroween!

Pharma AI has a $100B problem: models hit 95% accuracy in training, then drop to 50% (random!) on real data.

We built something that actually works.

TRAIRC analyzes Type II kinase inhibitors - a critical class of cancer drugs.

✅ 87.7% validated accuracy
✅ Tested on FDA-approved drugs
✅ Real-time analysis in seconds

Not training accuracy. REAL validation.

Built the entire system with @Kiro AI:

• Vibe coding → explored the problem space
• Specs → structured the solution
• Agent collab → refined everything

Kiro didn't just help. It was essential.

**Tweet 4:**
The business case is clear:

💰 Pharma pays $50K+/year for molecular tools
💰 TRAIRC delivers better results for $5K/month
💰 90% time savings

This is a real product, not a demo.
