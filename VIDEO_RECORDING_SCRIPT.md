# PART 2: VOICEOVER SCRIPT

Record this audio separately. Speak clearly and confidently. Match timing to your video.

---

## 0:00 - 0:10 (Title Slide)
> "TRAIRC. Type II Kinase Inhibitor Design Assistant. Built for the Kiroween Hackathon."

---

## 0:10 - 0:30 (Problem Slide)
> "Pharmaceutical companies spend over 100 billion dollars on AI drug discovery. But there's a massive problem. AI models achieve 95% accuracy on training data... then drop to just 50% on external validation. That's random chance. Coin flip territory. These models memorize data instead of learning chemistry."

---

## 0:30 - 0:45 (Solution Stats)
> "We built TRAIRC to solve this. 87.7% validated accuracy. Tested on 10 FDA-approved drugs. Real-time analysis in under 5 seconds."

---

## 0:45 - 0:55 (Features)
> "TRAIRC analyzes Type II kinase inhibitors - a critical class of cancer drugs. It uses physics-based scoring, not pattern matching."

---

## 0:55 - 1:00 (Transition to Demo)
> "Let me show you how it works."

---

## 1:00 - 1:15 (Show Interface)
> "This is TRAIRC's web interface. Clean, professional, production-ready."

---

## 1:15 - 1:25 (Click Imatinib)
> "Let's analyze Imatinib, also known as Gleevec. It's an FDA-approved Type II kinase inhibitor."

---

## 1:25 - 1:45 (Show Results)
> "Within seconds, TRAIRC provides a complete analysis. DFG-out score: 1.0 - Excellent. It correctly identifies Imatinib's Type II binding characteristics. The recommendation confirms it's a priority compound."

---

## 1:45 - 2:00 (Second Drug)
> "Let's try another drug - Sorafenib. Same result. Excellent Type II potential. This isn't training accuracy - this is real validation on real FDA-approved drugs."

---

## 2:00 - 2:15 (Business Value)
> "The business case is clear. Competitors charge 50,000 dollars or more per year. TRAIRC delivers better results for 5,000 a month. 90% time savings. 2 to 3x improved hit rates."

---

## 2:15 - 2:35 (Built with Kiro)
> "We built this entire system with Kiro AI. Vibe coding to explore the problem space. Specs for structured development. Agent collaboration throughout. Kiro wasn't just helpful - it was essential."
